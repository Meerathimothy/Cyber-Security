Task 1  Introduction

identifying vulnerabilities and coupling our research skills to learn how these can be abused

Task 2  Automated Vs. Manual Vulnerability Research

The vulnerability scanner Nessus has both a free (community) edition and commercial. The commercial version costing thousands, will likely be
used in organisations providing penetration testing services or audits

some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a vulnerability scanner

Manual scanning for vulnerabilities is often the weapon of choice by a penetration tester when testing individual applications or programs. 
In fact, manual scanning will involve searching for the same vulnerabilities and uses similar techniques as automated scanning

 vulnerabilities include

1) You are working close to a deadline for your penetration test and need to scan a web application quickly. Would you use an automated
scanner? (Yay/Nay)

YAY

2) You are testing a web application and find that you are able to input and retrieve data in a database.  What vulnerability is this?

INJECTION

3) You manage to impersonate another user. What vulnerability is this?

   Broken Access Control
 
Task 3 Finding Manual Exploits

Rapid7

Much like other services such as Exploit DB and NVD, Rapid7 is a vulnerability research database. The only difference being that this 
database also acts as an exploit database. Using this service, you can filter by type of vulnerability (I.e. application and operating 
system).

The database contains instructions for exploiting applications using the popular Metasploit tool.For example, this entry on Rapid7 is for 
“Wordpress Plugin SP Project & Document”, where we can see instructions on how to use an exploit module to abuse this vulnerability

GitHub

GitHub is extremely useful in finding rare or fresh exploits because anyone can create an account and upload – there is no formal 
verification process like there is with alternative exploit databases. With that said, there is also a downside in that PoC’s may not work
where little to no support will be provided.

Searchsploit

Searchsploit is a tool that is available on popular pentesting distributions such as Kali Linux. It is also available on the TryHackMe 
AttackBox. This tool is an offline copy of Exploit-DB, containing copies of exploits on your system. 

You are able to search searchsploit by application name and/or vulnerability type. For example, in the snippet below, we are searching 
searchsploit for exploits relating to Wordpress

1) What website would you use as a security researcher if you wanted to upload a Proof of Concept?

   github

2) You are performing a penetration test at a site with no internet connection. What tool could you use to find exploits to use?

   searchsploit

Task 4 Example for manual exploitation

The ability to execute commands on the victim that is running the vulnerable application or service is one of the most effective
vulnerabilities that we can exploit.

For example, being able to execute commands on the target that is executing the vulnerable application or service will allow us to read 
files or execute commands that we previously could not conduct using the application or service alone.

We may also utilize this to acquire a footing on the machine.

A foothold is an access to the compromised machine’s console, from which we can then begin to exploit other apps or machines on the network

1) What type of vulnerability was used in this attack?

Answer: Remote Code Execution

Task 5 Practical: Manual Exploitation

Deploy the machine attached to this task and wait a minimum of five minutes for it to be fully set up.
After five minutes, visit the webserver running on the machine by navigating to http://MACHINE_IP in the browser of the device connected to
the THM network (your own or the AttackBox).

1) Find out the version of the application that is running. What are the name and version number of the application?

  Online Book Store v1.0

 2) Now use the resources and skills from this module to find an exploit that will allow you to gain remote access to the vulnerable
     machine.

    Located at “Exploit-DB”

3)  Use this exploit against the vulnerable machine. What is the value of the flag located in a web directory?

   I did a quick search for Online Book Store v1.0 exploit . After looking through some of the results, I found this one for an 
   unauthenticated RCE in Exploit-DB: https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47887

   ![image](https://github.com/Meerathimothy/Cyber-Security/assets/57287429/d014c227-ccf9-43de-98f5-b0f5012f3556)

Then, in line 18, modify “help=The URL of the target” to my target’s website or IP address.

![image](https://github.com/Meerathimothy/Cyber-Security/assets/57287429/41218e34-78ca-4fcc-b22a-9c27352b1a88)

I had to enter the same “URL” that I had modified in the Python script.

![image](https://github.com/Meerathimothy/Cyber-Security/assets/57287429/da63c9ad-9e66-4bef-9220-2d413715ad0c)

If all goes well, I should be able to run the script and acquire access to the “RCE” area of the machine, indicating that we have 
successfully exploited and gained a foothold on the victim’s machine

Type “ls” to list the files and directories discovered on the victim’s machine, including “flag.txt”
