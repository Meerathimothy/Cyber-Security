                                 Metasploit
      
Metasploit is a  tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation. Primary usage is for pentrate Testimg.
 
Metasploit has two main versions:
1) Metasploit Pro - commercial version,GUI.
2) Metasploit Framework - open source,
Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability.command version.

Components Of Metasploit
i)   msfconsole - Main command line interface. Typing msfconsole command in terminal.
ii)  Modules - supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads.
iii) Tools - Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment,penetration testing

Exploit: A piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
Vulnerability: A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system.
Payload: An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability.Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

Auxiliary - Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers.

Encoders - Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them.
           Signature-based antivirus and security solutions have a database of known threats. They detect threats by comparing suspicious files to this database and raise an alert if there is a match.
           
Evasion - direct attempt to evade antivirus software.

Exploits - Exploits, neatly organized by target system.

NOPs - No Operation => Intel x86 CPU family, CPU will do nothing for one cycle
