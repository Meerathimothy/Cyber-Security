 3 core functions for thehive project to work:-
 
 1) Collaborate 
 
 Multiple analysts from one organisation can work together on the same case simultaneously. Through its live stream capabilities,
 every analyst can keep an eye on the cases in real time.
 
 2) Elaborate

 Details of each case can be broken down into associated tasks. Analysts can record their progress, attach artifacts of evidence and assign tasks.
 
 3) Act

Allow analysts to add observables to their cases, to flag IOCs and identify previously seen observables. 

TheHive Features & Integrations

Thehive project has platform rich feature set and integrations to support workflows. These features include:-

1) Case/Task Management

Every investigation is meant to a case that has been created. Each case can be broken down into one or more tasks or can be turned into templates for easier management.

2) Alert Triage

Cases can be imported from SIEM alerts, email reports and other security  sources. In this feature it will go through these imported alerts and decide whether they should be used into investigations or not.
