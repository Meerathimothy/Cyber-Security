Introduction

TheHive Project is a Security Incident Response Platform. 

TheHive Project is a scalable, open-source and freely available Security Incident Response Platform . It is used to track, investigate and act upon identified security incident. It ensuring real-time information applicable to new or existing cases,

 3 core functions for thehive project to work:-
 
 1) Collaborate 
 
 Multiple analysts from one organisation can work together on the same case simultaneously. Through its live stream capabilities,
 every analyst can keep an eye on the cases in real time.
 
 2) Elaborate

 Details of each case can be broken down into associated tasks. Analysts can record their progress, attach artifacts of evidence and assign tasks. 
 
 3) Act

Allow analysts to add observables to their cases, to flag IOCs and identify previously seen observables. 

TheHive Features & Integrations

Thehive project has platform rich feature set and integrations to support workflows. These features include:-

1) Case/Task Management

Every investigation is meant to a case that has been created. Each case can be broken down into one or more tasks or can be turned into templates for easier management.

2) Alert Triage

Cases can be imported from SIEM alerts, email reports and other security  sources. In this feature it will go through these imported alerts and decide whether they should be used into investigations or not.

3) Observable Enrichment with Cortex

One of the main feature integrations TheHive supports is Cortex. Cortex allows analysts to collect more information from threat indicators by performing correlation analysis and developing patterns from the cases.

4) Active Response

Run active actions to communicate, share information about incidents and prevent or contain a threat.

5) Custom Dashboard

Statistics on cases, tasks, observables, metrics etc. can be compiled and distributed on dashboards which is  used to generate KPIs within an organisation. 

6) Built-in MISP Integration 

Another useful integration is with MISP. It is a platform for sharing and storing IOC of targeted attacks, financial fraud, vulnerability information or even terrorism information. This integration allows analysts to create cases from MISP events

Other notable integrations that TheHive supports are DigitalShadows2TH & ZeroFox2TH
