1. Learn the basic working of Wi-Fi and its types with various types of attacks on it.

Wi-Fi works by using radio waves to transmit data between devices and a wireless access point, which is connected to the internet or a network. The access point acts as 
a central hub that allows devices to connect to the network and communicate with each other. When a device wants to connect to a Wi-Fi network, it sends a request to the 
access point. The access point then assigns the device an IP address and allows it to communicate with other devices on the network.The data that is transmitted between 
devices and the access point is encrypted using various security protocols, such as WEP, WPA, and WPA2.

Types Of Wifi Attacks

a. Eavesdropping: This attack involves intercepting Wi-Fi traffic to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data.

b. Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack: This attack involves intercepting and modifying Wi-Fi traffic to gain access to sensitive information.

c. Rogue access point: This attack involves setting up a fake Wi-Fi network to trick users into connecting to it and stealing their data.

d. Denial-of-service (DoS) attack: This attack involves overwhelming a Wi-Fi network with traffic to disrupt its normal operation.

e. Password cracking: This attack involves using software to guess or crack the Wi-Fi network's password and gain access to the network.

f. Packet injection: This attack involves injecting malicious packets into a Wi-Fi network to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access.

2. Perform Wi-Fi fingerprinting using Wigile, Inssider, and Kismet

Wi-Fi fingerprinting is the process of gathering information about the Wi-Fi access points and their characteristics in a particular area.

 Wigle
 
 Wigile is an open-source tool that can be used to map Wi-Fi networks and their characteristics. It uses a GPS device to collect location information and a wireless 
 adapter
